# apcsp-project
Abandoned 2D platformer originally planned to be my apcsp final project.

This was originally going to be my AP Computer Science Principles project, but
I realized as I was just finishing the project that it was poorly optimized,
the codebase was way too long for some poor college board employee to grade,
and it just wasn't very good.

That's ok though! This was my first real project in Rust, and it served as
a great introduction to my new absolute favorite language. If you're interested
in seeing what I decided to actually submit, check out lispt, another
repository on my account. It's private at the time of archiving this
platformer (college board probably doesn't want my project code public)
but I'll unprivate it when it's been graded (which should be in late
summer 2023). Thanks for reading!
